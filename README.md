# Google-2
Better than google

Things wasnt able to do
- Put a favicon
- Make a searchbar with icons inside of it. So i changed strategy
- Put the buttons borders inside of them and not outside
- couldnt work on interactions and specific actions but the visuals are here
- other small things

Structure :

There is a big flexbox called content, inside of it there is header, center and footer
I'd be happy to learn from all my mistakes because this clearly is a mess

thanks for your time
